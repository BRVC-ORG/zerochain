Zero Chain (stylized: 0chain) Attack

Can classical server-side certificates be exploited somehow as Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) or as smart contracts, technically, in order to try to eavesdrop and manipulate the cross-bridge communication(s) between a proprietary DON (Decentralized Oracle Network) and its chosen chain, or to rapidly create multi-domain, multi-chain singular points-of-attack between future-built, hybrid-like environs, involving non-cloud DeFi platforms utilizing both BNEs (Blockchain Node Engines) and custom, permissioned, Hyperledger-type chains, ran and verified on custom, locally-produced Nodes or vNodes, which theoretically can be modified to concurrently-perform “mining-like” hashing, enabling even further processing-manipulation by also switching between PoW and PoS chains for discreet, at-scale, Torrent-like storing of rudimentary, shadow copies of in-future-hashed-block info plus already-on-chain private data, with retrograde-facing "arcOracle"-compatibility and -readability for discovering "0Chain" vulnerabilities?

Essentially, a scenario where replica chain(s) and any and all data contained wherein/therein is, through a combination of approaches, (intermittently, concurrently, RAID-like, Generatively-scaled and -strengthened botnetweb-type DONs and onchain OS vulnerabilities with multi-bridge, consensus-targeting penetration methodologies which cease not until desired zeroday implementation(s) abound, creating a fast-moving, contra-traditional-generative “meshing” of zerodays and bad acting), when combined, are known collectively as: 0chain (or, interchangeably, as a “forced Layer0trojanARC”)

NationStateARCing: using compromised web2-to-web5 data oracles in a futurized version of Decentralized Finance markets, where a legitimately-secure browser for the concurrent decentralized internet onboarding boom is unavailable, and when both consumer demand for and ease of use of the new internet are seemingly close…cold wallets and proprietary chains of varying make and model are suddenly easily, swiftly infected or modified with unforeseen exploits: subtle ones, for creating unassuming, non-consensus-produced, exploitable "block data," sidestepping decades of cryptographically-sound data: piggybacking off of and within a possible proof-of-work vulnerability, or an AES/SHA rootkit-type methodology, performed both remotely or on-site with innumerable hybrid setups.  Center of universe: smart contracts (“software-produced” and “stateless of origin”) then become, understandably, the heated focus of classical, textual-based lawyering and legislation at most every level; yet with increased pressures of nationalization by some and the idea of viewing hardware- and software-based consensus in the same vein as historical responses to strikes, union actions and the like
